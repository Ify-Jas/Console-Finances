My financial analysis challenge

## Description

This week's challenge was to create a Financial analysis using a set of data provided in the starter pack. This challenge allowed me to make use of the little javascript I have learnt in week leading up to this challenge. It also allowed me to think outside the box and find solutions outside what we had learnt the previous week.

I found this challenge quite difficult as my knowledge of javascript is still limited. It involved a lot of reading and research to atleast get up to the level I did. 

To get the result, I used excel analysis to analyse my data, I then went about using JavaScript to programme a solution that will allow me to do the same analysis. 

I broke down my solution in stages and I used comments on the script to allow myself and others understand the reasoning behind some of the codes.

My analysis is contained in the mylogic.js file.
